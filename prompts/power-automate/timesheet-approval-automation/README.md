# Timesheet Tracking Automation

## Description

This prompt helps with automating your employee timesheet approval process. When a new timesheet record is added in your defined system, it sends an approval to the submitter's manager.  If the manager approves, it starts another approval for HR approval. Notifications are sent to the submitter along the way.

## Prompt
Build a workflow that routes employee timesheets submitted in [Start of Text] SharePoint [End of Text] for approval from the employee's manager. If the manager approvers, send another approval to HR.  If the manager rejects, notify the submitter and end the workflow.
