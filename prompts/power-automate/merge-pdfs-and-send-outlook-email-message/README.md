# Merge PDF files and send merged file as an attachment in an Outlook email message

## Description

This prompt helps with automating the merge of PDF files and sending the merged PDF file in Power Automate for desktop with Copilot. Copilot will identify the required actions and add them to the designer. The flow will display a message to ask the user to select PDF files to merge and merge the PDF files into a single file. Outlook will then be launched where the merged will be attached to the email message and send the email message before closing Outlook.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In the _Send an email message through Outlook_ action, you'll need to enter your email address in the _Account_ field as the action will use this email address as the user account for Outlook.

## Prompt
I want to create automation that prompts the user to select PDF files to merge where the chosen files are merged, and then send an email through Outlook to [email address] with the merged PDF files as an attachment
