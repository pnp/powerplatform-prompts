Create a rental inspection data model with the following tables: Properties (ID, Address, Type, Status), Inspections (ID, Property as Lookup, Inspector, Date, Status, Notes), Issues (ID, Inspection as Lookup, Description, Category, Severity, Status, Photo), and Inspectors (ID, Name, Contact, Assigned Properties). A property can have multiple inspections, an inspection can have multiple issues, and inspectors can be assigned to multiple properties.
