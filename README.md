# Power Platform GPT Prompts

Welcome to the "Power Platform GPT Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with GPT models in the Power Platform.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with GPT. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/pnp/powerplatform-prompts#-power-platform-gpt-prompts) to the list, and to use GPT to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using GPT with the Power Platform!

> ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected or may be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same.
